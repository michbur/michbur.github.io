I'm a fond user of the [xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xtable). There are many alternatives, as **kable** from [kable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr), but I have still preferred my old golden standard. Nevertheless, I'm always trying to learn something new and the [pixiedust](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pixiedust) package immediately caught my eye. It uses pipes, works for many outputs (see [HERE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pixiedust/vignettes/sprinkles.html) ) and seems to be really flexible.
