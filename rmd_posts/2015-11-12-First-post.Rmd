# Very brief introduction

This blog is devoted to my experience with R. I will especially focus on obscure R packages that I found interesting and useful.

Below I'm testing some features of my blog, like:

# MathJax

$$
y = x^2 + x
$$

# Embedding and printing R code

```{r}
library(dplyr)
dat <- data.frame(x = -100:100) %>% 
  mutate(y = x^2 + x)

head(dat)
```

# Tables

```{r, results='asis'}
kable(head(dat))
```

# Figures

```{r, results='asis'}
plot(dat, type = "l")
```
