R has several implementations of [Random Forests technique](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm). One of them, [ranger package](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ranger) recently caught my eye. Coming from the same group that developed Random Jungle [@schwarz_safari_2010], another quick implementation of Random Forests, **ranger** was immediately implemented in my data analysis frameworks.

More details and exhaustive benchmarks can be found in the article describing **ranger** accessible currently on  [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04409).
